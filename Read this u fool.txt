Hello 
I think u want totk on ur pc so i made this instructions to help with the process
Its simple but it can be tricky if you dont know what ur doing so read carefully.

- FIRST - COPY all of the files in this folder onto ur computer (instructions are optional)

In order to download it CORRECTLY u gotta get ryujinx from github i used version 1.799 or smth 

then u gotta find the legend of zelda totk .xci file I downloaded it on this flash drive for ur convinence so just copy it over on ur computer (I suggest you make a folder for all of you emulators and make a sub folder for the games)

Next you have to open the ryujinx software, It will need to be unzipped after downloading so do that and open the application from the now unzipped folder downloaded and there should be a bar at the top for options, file, etc
	
	go to the instal firmaware and select the first option where you install from a zip or xci file.
	You will need to select the firmware zip file on this (you dont need to unzip the file) and that should be all good. 

	now the keys 
	To download the keys its a little difficult but still pretty simple
	first unzip the keys file and you should get a folder with two files 
	open ryujinx and go to file in the top left and click "open ryujinx file"
	then open the "system" folder and put the two files from the keys zip into the system folder
	all done now you can leave this folder

To now set up the game you need to set the directory so the program can run the game

This is simple 
go to options in the top left and select "settings"
now in "general" go down to game directories and add your directory (if you did as i sugessted itll be simple to find ur games cus you set up a sub folder and moved totk.xci into it)

Now ur done and totk should show up under the menu bar if it doesnt look further down this file and look at the settings and make sure your settings are correct

Graphics upgrade:
theres a file called 60fps in this folder that you should put in a sub folder in ur emulator folder for ryujinx
to use you need to open ryujinx folder from "file" and in mods put the 60fps mod into the exefs_patches folder or nro_patches folder idk (TBH i still havent figured out how to make it work) and close the app and rerun it

-WAIT-
some important settings to not miss 
	
	in options>settings>General
	set check for updates on launch to off (u dont want it to update and mess up ur save)

	in options>settings>input 
	you should set up ur controller or keybinds
	SET DOCKED MODE TO ON (if you dont it will preform terribly)

	in options>settings>system
	in HACKS set ignore Missing Services to on if you dont want to look at errors

	
	in options>settings>Graphics
	set graphics backend to either Vulkan if your computer uses an AMD graphics card or OpenGl for an nvidia card (Idk for intel or integrated graphics)(you can check graphics cards in system information by searching "system information" in the windows bar for windows
	set "prefered GPU to whatever gpu you are useing
	set resolution scale in accordance to your monitor
	set post processing effect to none for better preformance
